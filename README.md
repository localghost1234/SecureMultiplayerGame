# Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game

Project for creating a 2D game using secure code practices, which include mainly:
- The client should not be able to guess/sniff the MIME type
- Prevent XSS attacks
- Do not cache anything from the website in the client
- The headers say that the site is powered by PHP 7.4.3
